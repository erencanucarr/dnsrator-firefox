# Privacy Policy for DNSRator

**Effective Date:** [01.06.2025]

DNSRator is a browser extension that enables users to quickly and easily view DNS records (such as A, MX, CNAME, TXT, SPF, DKIM, DMARC, and others) of websites directly from their browser. It is designed for web developers, cybersecurity professionals, network administrators, and anyone interested in learning about DNS systems.

## Data Collection and Usage

DNSRator **does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data or identifiable information** from its users. The extension operates entirely locally within your browser and performs all lookups without sending any user-specific data to external servers controlled by us.

We do not:

- Track your browsing activity  
- Store any DNS query results  
- Use cookies or similar tracking technologies  
- Share any information with third parties  

## Permissions

DNSRator may require access to specific browser APIs solely to provide its intended functionality (e.g., reading the domain of the active tab to fetch DNS records). These permissions are used **only in real-time and locally**, with no data transmitted or saved.

## Third-Party Services

DNSRator does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms. No external scripts or tracking technologies are used.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If any significant changes are made, we will update the "Effective Date" at the top of this page. Continued use of the extension after any updates constitutes your acceptance of the revised policy.
