#  DNSRator - A FireFox DNS Tool Extensions

For anyone with an interest in web development, cybersecurity, or simply how the internet functions, DNSRator is a practical tool that allows you to easily view the DNS records (A, AAAA, MX, CNAME, TXT, NS, etc.) of websites. Without the need for complex command lines or external websites, you can instantly examine the DNS infrastructure of any page you visit.

What does DNSRator do?

• You can quickly check the propagation of DNS changes.
• You can easily view the mail servers (MX records) of websites.
• You can examine domain name redirections (CNAME records).
• You can obtain information about email authentication records (such as SPF and DKIM TXT records).
• You can view the authoritative name servers (NS records) of a website.

In summary, DNSRator offers a valuable insight into the technical infrastructure of websites. I believe it is a particularly useful tool for web developers, system administrators, and cybersecurity professionals.
